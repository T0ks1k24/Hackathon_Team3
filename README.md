### Backend (Python / Django)

Ensure you have Python 3.10+ and pip installed.

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv env

# Windows
source env/Scripts/activate

# MacOS/Linux
source env/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Frontend (React)

Ensure Node.js and npm are installed.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

---

## 🚀 Running the Project

### Backend (Django)

```bash
cd backend
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

### Frontend (React)

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

* Frontend → [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 🧠 Conclusions / Next Steps

🔚 Our site is not yet a full-fledged library, but it’s no longer just a notebook hack. In 4 days we built working authentication, book search, a catalog, and UI — and that’s already a **victory** (small “v”, bold font).

💤 Countless sleepless nights, more coffee than code, and our team mantra:
**“I still know nothing, but I’m already coding!”**

👨‍💻 Despite teammates being like:

* “team knows nothing yet”
* “team went to sleep”
* “team forgot to push to git”

Everyone contributed — even those who joked more than coded!

---

### 📅 What We Plan to Add

* 💾 Save books to favorites (likes, bookmarks)
* ⭐ Book ratings and reviews
* 📥 Admin panel for manual book adding
* 📦 Parser for new online sources
* 🌗 Dark/light theme (partially done)
* 📱 Mobile adaptation
* 🛡️ More validations and security

---

🎉 The project became more than just code — it was an adventure: bugs, fixes, chaos in Discord, and memes instead of documentation 😄

We learned more than expected, wrote more code than planned, and of course — slept less than we should have.
